      <description>Hey everyone! Hope yall are doing well!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of a painting I managed to complete during this COVID-19 quarantine. I&amp;rsquo;m not an art person at all, so I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of myself!

library(reticulate) ## Warning: package &#39;reticulate&#39; was built under R version 3.</description>
